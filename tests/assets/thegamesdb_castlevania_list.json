                "overview": "As its name implies, this version of the game revisits the classic Castlevania II: Simon Quest which first appeared on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Graphically, they've cleaned the game up quite a bit to look like a 16-bit game, and they've added tons of other new features, like a save function and a better menu system.\r\n\r\nThe game itself boasts many improvements on its original version. Jumping, for example, is much more fluid and precise; even the combat system is more exact and enjoyable. There is also a good variety of enemies that have been recreated, which really gives a boost to combat, compared to earlier titles.\r\n\r\nCastlevania II: Simon Quest Revamped is an excellent representation of the Castlevania franchise. Not only is it considerably better than the original, but it provides an excellent game for fans of the 'metroidvania' genre who don't have many options available for PC.",

Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!",

Though defeated by vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, Dracula's curse continues to ravage the European countryside, spreading disease, mob violence, and heresy in its wake. Amidst all this devastation is Hector, a Devil Forgemaster who had formerly worked under the employ of Dracula but betrayed him sometime during the events of Castlevania III. Eventually growing disgusted with Dracula's brutal methods, Hector leaves Castlevania and relinquishes his powers to live amongst humans, settling down to live a peaceful life. When Hector's fiance Rosaly is accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake, Hector learns that her murder was directed by his fellow Forgemaster, Isaac. Seeking revenge, Hector chases his former colleague back to his old home, and back to the demonic life he believed he had left behind him.",
